This app was made while learning Kotlin.

Code can be found in .kt files inside the [main/starwarsplanets](/app/src/main/java/com/cpw/starwarsplanets) folder.

Layouts are located in .xml files in the [layout](/app/src/main/res/layout) folder.

While I did not create most of the code for this app, I helped debug and update the code after Android Studio's Electric Eel update broke it.
  It was then built during a lesson on Firebase.
  
I made the background for each planet on the list appear transparent rather than solid black.

I also added every planet that wasn't included, that I could find, to the database.

This is the final app.
